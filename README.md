# Introduction
This repository focuses on analyzing the diamonds dataset to understand factors influencing diamond pricing. The goal was to explore the relationship between carat size, cut quality, and price using visualizations and data analysis techniques.

# Implementation
To analyze the dataset, we used the R programming language and the ggplot2 library. A scatter plot was created to examine the relationship between carat size and price, with faceting applied to separate the analysis by cut quality. A trend line was added to highlight price patterns across different cuts. Challenges in ensuring clear visualization were addressed by refining plot themes and adjusting the legend for better interpretability.

# Results
The plot shows that diamond prices generally increase with carat size across all cut qualities, with noticeable differences in variability. Fair cuts exhibit the most price variability, while Premium and Ideal cuts show smoother and more consistent trends. Good and Very Good cuts fall in between, with moderate variability. Higher price levels are indicated by darker points, emphasizing the influence of carat size and cut quality on pricing.
